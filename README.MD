## 🛠️ Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

* **C++17** Compiler (e.g., GCC/MinGW)
* **CMake** ≥ 4.2.0
* **GLFW**
* **OpenGL**
* **Windows Platform** (Primary target)

### Build Steps (Windows + MinGW Example)

```powershell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
mingw32-make

```

After a successful build, the executable can be found at `build/DearAlarm.exe`.

---

## 🚀 Quick Distribution

To run the application, simply bundle the following **3 files**:

```
DearAlarm.exe    # Main executable (statically linked)
app_icon.png     # Icon loaded dynamically at runtime
alarm.mp3        # Alarm sound effect (hardcoded path)

```

> 💡 **Note:** `alarm.mp3` must be located in the same directory as `DearAlarm.exe`; otherwise, the alarm sound will not play!

---

## 🎵 Key Features

* **System Tray Residency:** Minimize to tray and click to bring up the settings interface.
* **Multiple Alarms:** Support for setting multiple scheduled reminders.
* **Customizable Audio:** Support for custom alarm sounds (currently fixed to `alarm.mp3`).
* **Cross-platform Architecture:** Built on a portable framework (currently tested on Windows).
